This is just a collection of scripts/aliases I wrote for mIRC that I happen to find useful.
after years of constantly re-writing the same aliases over and over, I decided I needed a solid "library" of sorts.

Not all of this will be useful. there will be some things I wrote just because I think they're cool/fun. Not all of this will be good. Not all of this will have helpful comments. I'm not sure why I'm sharing any of this, but here you are.

Also, github really needs proper msl syntax highlighting.
